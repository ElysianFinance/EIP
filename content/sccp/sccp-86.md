When opening a pull request to submit your ECCP, please use an abbreviated title in the filename, `eccp-draft_title_abbrev.md`. The title should be 44 characters or less.-->

## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the ECCP.-->

Open up a new new merging window for a 2 week period.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the variable change proposed.-->

Proposing to trigger the `startMergingWindow` method which initiates a new merging epoch.

## Motivation

<!--The motivation is critical for ECCPs that want to update variables within Elysian. It should clearly explain why the existing variable is not incentive aligned. ECCP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

Given sDAO's intention to migrate to a new account, this ECCP proposes to open up the account merging window for a 2-week period.
