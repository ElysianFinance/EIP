## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the ECCP.-->

This ECCP proposes to lower the wrappr mintFeeRate to 5 bp from 25 bp.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the variable change proposed.-->

Setting the minting fee at 5 bp will effectively end the rollout of the wrapper program and ensure that the peg on ETH is as low friction as possible.

## Motivation

<!--The motivation is critical for ECCPs that want to update variables within Elysian. It should clearly explain why the existing variable is not incentive aligned. ECCP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

Lowering the `mintFeeRate` to 5 bp will ensure that sETH stays pegged against ETH.
