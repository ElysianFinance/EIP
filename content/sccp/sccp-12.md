## Update (20/02/2020)

As part of the Achernar release, we are reactivating these assets.

## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the ECCP.-->

The vast majority of frontrunning activity is concentrated in three synth asset pairs:

- sXTZ/iXTX
- sLTC/iLTC
- sBNB/iBNB

As Kain pointed out in ECCP 11, the volume of frontrunning transactions is increasing again. With Fee Reclamation still several weeks away, there needs to be some sort of short term fix. This ECCP proposes that these three pairs are disabled immediately and enabled in the same release as Fee Reclamation.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the variable change proposed.-->

Disable these asset pairs immediately, but with the explicit intention to reactivate them in the same release as Fee Reclamation.

## Motivation

<!--The motivation is critical for ECCPs that want to update variables within Elysian. It should clearly explain why the existing variable is not incentive aligned. ECCP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

The suggestions to this point have been to either 1) raise fees system-wide to 100 bps, 2) slash frontrunner accounts, 3) or selectively disable assets.

Solution #1 may discourage frontrunners but will also harm good-faith stakers/hedgers and traders. It's also bad PR with traders who are potential future sX users.

Solution #2 is overly aggressive, sets a dangerous precedent, is somewhat arbitrary and could be deployed arbitrarily in the future. It would discourage frontrunners but at a high cost from a PR perspective and future governance perspective.

Solution #3 seems kind of weak, but achieves the goal of removing the surface space for these attacks. It's a potential PR problem, but to preempt that narrative, this ECCP suggests that all disabled synths should be explicitly scheduled to be re-enabled in the same release as Fee Reclamation. More deliberate conversations should be had then about whether certain of these assets (especially XTX) should be listed at all.
