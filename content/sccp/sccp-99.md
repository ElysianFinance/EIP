## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the ECCP.-->

The current `maxDebt` was configured to be sUSD 90 million in [ECCP-95](https://eips.elysian.finance/ECCP/eccp-95) has been reached, this eccp proposes to increase it to sUSD 110 million given the increased demand for shorts.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the variable change proposed.-->

The cap if increased to sUSD 110 million allows users to continue to take loans and shorts without interruption.

## Motivation

<!--The motivation is critical for ECCPs that want to update variables within Elysian. It should clearly explain why the existing variable is not incentive aligned. ECCP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

Total debt has already been reached. Therefore raising the cap will allows users to continue to open short positions without interruption.
