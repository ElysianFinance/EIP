## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the ECCP.-->

Increase the number of Elysian Council seats from 7 members to 8 members.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the variable change proposed.-->

This ECCP is relating to the configurable number present in EIP-93. The initial number of Elysian Council members was set at 7, this proposal is to configure this value and set it to 8.

## Motivation

<!--The motivation is critical for ECCPs that want to update variables within Elysian. It should clearly explain why the existing variable is not incentive aligned. ECCP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

With the election period officially ending, we have observed that there was a rapid fluctuation of votes between the top 8 nominees which prevented the issuance of Elysian Council roles. As the fluctuations are occuring between nominees which have very tightly distributed weight debt (WD) this proposal is to increase the number of seats to 8 to temporarily resolve this issue. This measure will also give the Elysian community time to further discuss the components of liquid governance that it wishes to retain.
