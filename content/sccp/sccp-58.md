## Simple Summary

Increase fees on trades into sDEFI, iDEFI, sCEX and iCEX to 100 bp.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the variable change proposed.-->

This ECCP suggests to raise fees on sDEFI, iDEFI, sCEX and iCEX to counter front-running activities that have been noticed recently.

## Motivation

Analysis of on-chain data showed that front-running opportunities were more accessible for these synths given the fees levied 30 bp while the threshold frequency by chainlink is 1%.
