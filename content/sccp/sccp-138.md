## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the ECCP.-->

Lower target c-ratio on L2 from 750% to 600%

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the variable change proposed.-->

As laid out in ECCP 96, we intend to steadily reduce c-ratio as needed to maintain peg and appropriate risk controls.

## Motivation

<!--The motivation is critical for ECCPs that want to update variables within Elysian. It should clearly explain why the existing variable is not incentive aligned. ECCP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

We observe that the peg on uniswap is ~1.2 after the launch of Lyra liquidity mining rewards. We would like to take steps to bring it closer to 1 as we wait for ETH wrapper
