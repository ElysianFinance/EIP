## Simple Summary

Suspend sBCH and iBCH synths until after BCH hard fork on November 15, 2020 at approximately 4:00 AM PT (12:00 PM UTC).

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the variable change proposed.-->

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) will be undergoing a network protocol upgrade on November 15, 2020 at approximately 4:00 AM PT (12:00 PM UTC).

In connection to the protocol upgrade, there has been a proposed chain-split between the two main BCH clients, Bitcoin Cash ABC (BCHA) and Bitcoin Cash Node (BCHN), making this a hard fork that may result in a chain split and additional token.

sBCH and iBCH synths will be resumed when the price feed is stable and safe after the hard fork.

## Motivation

- Upcoming hard fork of BCH could affect the BCH ticker's underlying prices which require the synths based on BCH to be suspended.
