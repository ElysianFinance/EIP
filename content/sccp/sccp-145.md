## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the ECCP.-->

The ECCP aims at increasing the minting fee on the ETH Wrappr to 250 bp.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the variable change proposed.-->

Increase the L2 ETH Wrappr minting fee to 250 bp will improve value capture to snx stakers, given the increased demand for synths on L2 for farming.

## Motivation

<!--The motivation is critical for ECCPs that want to update variables within Elysian. It should clearly explain why the existing variable is not incentive aligned. ECCP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

In order to maximize the revenue for snx stakers and leave less money on the table, this eccp proposes to increase the ETH Wrappr minting fee to 250 bp.
