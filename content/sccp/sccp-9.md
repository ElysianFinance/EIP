## Simple Summary

I propose re-enabling iXTZ (Inverse Tezos) and iBNB (Inverse Binance Coin) with new limits.
(n.b. originally this EIP only proposed re-enabling iXTZ but was updated before the release as during that time, iBNB also froze)

## Abstract

iXTZ and iBNB allow traders to effectively take a short position on Tezos and Binance Coin respectively. Since they reached their limits as a result of Tezos appreciating and Binance Coin depreciating in price recently, they have both frozen. If people are to continue taking inverse positions on Tezos or Binance Coin, a new iXTZ and iBNB will need to be enabled.

## Motivation

iXTZ and iBNB are two of our existing Synths, and our usual practice when an Inverse Synth gets frozen is to re-enable it in the next release.

## Implementation

The iXTZ entry price is $1.57 and the limits will be $0.785 and $2.355. The iBNB entry price is $12.57 and the limits will be $6.29 and $18.86.
