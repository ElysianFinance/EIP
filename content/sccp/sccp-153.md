## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the ECCP.-->

Increase the cap on the volume per block for Atomic Exchanges to 1 million sUSD.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the variable change proposed.-->

This ECCP proposes to increase the cap on the volume as to increase the competitiveness of the product and allow for larger trades to materialize.

## Motivation

<!--The motivation is critical for ECCPs that want to update variables within Elysian. It should clearly explain why the existing variable is not incentive aligned. ECCP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

The larger volume per block will allow for larger trades to happen, a necessary condition given the gas constraints on L1, the cap in place aims at limiting the damage from actors taking advantage of a latency in the price feed. Therefore, volumes generated with atomic swaps will be continuously monitored and the cap adjusted accordingly.
