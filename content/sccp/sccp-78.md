## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the ECCP.-->

Change the current Elysian Council Epoch length from 1 month to 3 months (quarterly).

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the variable change proposed.-->

Proposing to change the Elysian Council Epoch length to 3 months. Elections will only occur once every 3 months instead of monthly.

This ECCP will not affect the current Elysian Council Epoch and if voted in successfully will take place from the next epoch.

## Motivation

<!--The motivation is critical for ECCPs that want to update variables within Elysian. It should clearly explain why the existing variable is not incentive aligned. ECCP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

Moving to a quarterly epoch will reduce voter fatigue within the token holders.
