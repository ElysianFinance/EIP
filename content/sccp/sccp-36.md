## Simple Summary

Increase the fees on trades into sNIKKEI and sFTSE.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the variable change proposed.-->

As per [eip-56](https://github.com/elysianDAO/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-56.md) each synth can now have its own fee levels. This ECCP suggest to raise the fees on stock synths to 50 bp.

## Motivation

Analysis of on-chain data showed that front-running opportunities were more accessible for stock synths. Increasing the fees to 50 bp should shrink that window significantly and bolster the protection until [eip-52](https://eips.elysian.finance/eips/eip-52) is implemented.
