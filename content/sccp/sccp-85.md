## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the ECCP.-->

Current cap is set to 20m. We currently have 19.5m worth of shorts and loans, so there is not much room for new users to take loans or short available assets.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the variable change proposed.-->

The cap can safely be increased to 30m to allow more users to take loans or short available assets.

## Motivation

<!--The motivation is critical for ECCPs that want to update variables within Elysian. It should clearly explain why the existing variable is not incentive aligned. ECCP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

The cap of 20m has almost been reached. Given that we want to promote using the new shorting mechanism as a longterm replacement for iSynths, we want to increase the cap.
We have been watching user behaviour during the first week of promoted shorting and have alleviated concerns that drove the initial cap, so we can safely increase it to 30m now and continue monitoring it.
