## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the ECCP.-->

Propose to decrease the SNX rewards paid to incentivize the Curve sUSD pool to SNX 8k per week.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the variable change proposed.-->

There is currently a premium on sUSD compared to other stable coins on Curve. Decreasing the SNX incentive paid might slightly reduce the farming incentive on curve.

## Motivation

<!--The motivation is critical for ECCPs that want to update variables within Elysian. It should clearly explain why the existing variable is not incentive aligned. ECCP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

The recent premium on the sUSD peg on Curve calls for action as traders feel a disincentive in paying the premium to partake in trading.
