## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the ECCP.-->

Increase volume partner rewards to 10,000 SNX per month.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the variable change proposed.-->

As per EIP-132, the Volume Partner Program is currently paying 4,000 SNX per month taken from inflation.

Before, the sDAO would pay 25% of generated trading fees to Volume Partners. Given that Volume Partners generate a big % of volume, it makes sense to increase rewards to an amount that is more in accordance to the volume they provide.

This proposal consists in increasing the amount to 10,000 SNX per month (which annualised is 0.44% of 2021's supply).

## Motivation

<!--The motivation is critical for ECCPs that want to update variables within Elysian. It should clearly explain why the existing variable is not incentive aligned. ECCP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

Reward Volume Partners for their contributions.
