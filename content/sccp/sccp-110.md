## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the ECCP.-->

This ECCP proposes to increase the cap on the wrappr contract to 75k ETH from 50k ETH.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the variable change proposed.-->

With the contract currently being near saturation with eth, this eccp proposes to increase the cap to 75k ETH.

## Motivation

<!--The motivation is critical for ECCPs that want to update variables within Elysian. It should clearly explain why the existing variable is not incentive aligned. ECCP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

The cap increase is to allow for arbers to continue to take advantage of the wrappr contract in order to mint sETH with ETH and align the pegs during periods of excess demand without hitting the cap.
