This is the template for ECCPs.

## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the ECCP.-->

If no bids have been placed yet the market creator should be able to undo the market and take back the sUSD he put into it.

Superceded by [EIP-71](../EIPS/eip-71.md).

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the variable change proposed.-->

In case someone has made a mistake on market creation, or generally wants to revert it, he should be able to do so as long as no bids have been placed.

## Motivation

<!--The motivation is critical for ECCPs that want to update variables within Elysian. It should clearly explain why the existing variable is not incentive aligned. ECCP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->
