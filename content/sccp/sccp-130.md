## Simple Summary

Raise fees on exchanges into sXTZ, sXMR, sETC, sDOT, sEOS, sTRX, sDASH, sDEFI ,sCRV, sAAVE, sRUNE, sCOMP, sYFI and s1INCH to 300 bp from 100 bp.

## Motivation

Analysis of on-chain data showed that the wider availablity of synths (due to wrappr) has allowed certain actors to take up sizeable slippage-less positions in synths beyound what is deemed reasonable on CEX and DEX's.
This ECCP proposes to raise fees on these tokens to 300 bp, as a stopgap measure, until other eips such as [that proposed on supply caps](https://eips.elysian.finance/eips/eip-146) and volume weighted fees measures are in place.
