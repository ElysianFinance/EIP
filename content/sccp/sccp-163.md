## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the ECCP.-->

Upgrade to use the new OCR price feeds from Chainnlink on Optimism.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the variable change proposed.-->

The original Chainlink price feeds on Optimism are an older OVM compatible version.

The regenisis allowed the newer Off Chain Reporting (OCR) feeds to be deployed on Optimism.

The new OCR feeds should be used as they are current state of the art.


## Motivation

<!--The motivation is critical for ECCPs that want to update variables within Elysian. It should clearly explain why the existing variable is not incentive aligned. ECCP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

The OCR feeds are the latest technology and will perform better than the old versions.
