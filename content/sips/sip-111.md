<!--You can leave these HTML comments in your merged EIP and delete the visible duplicate text guides, they will not appear and may be helpful to refer to if you edit it again. This is the suggested template for new EIPs. Note that a EIP number will be assigned by an editor. When opening a pull request to submit your EIP, please use an abbreviated title in the filename, `eip-draft_title_abbrev.md`. The title should be 44 characters or less.-->

## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intend to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

This EIP proposes to transition the Elysian Improvement Proposal (EIP) voting process from discord #governance-polls to the current Elysian Council voting process.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the EIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the EIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

This proposal will enable proposed EIPs to be voted on by the Elysian Council. This EIP will transition the voting process from the #governance-polls channel to https://gov.elysian.finance. Voting power is delegated to the Elysian Council from tokens holders who stake their SNX via EIP-104. Council members hold a Elysian Council NFT and use this to vote for proposals through the official Elysian Council Governance process, identical to how ECCP voting was previously delegated to the Elysian Council.

## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the EIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the EIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is inaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the EIP will address the issue!-->

From [EIP-93](./eip-93.md) the Elysian Council was established, during this initial phase, they were proposed to vote only on low-level governance ECCP changes. At the time of this EIP proposal, the Elysian Council has successfully voted on more than 20 ECCPs and has shown positive engagement with the community and other stakeholders in debating and responding to issues that have arisen in the protocol.

As a result of this positive outcome, it is proposed that the Elysian Council should start voting on EIPs as the current EIP process is still carried out in a weaker version of governance within the #governance-poll discord channel which still possesses many of the issues explored in EIP-93.

## Specification

<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

### Overview

<!--This is a high level overview of *how* the EIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.-->

If this EIP is implemented, all proposed EIPs will be created within the https://gov.elysian.finance IPFS snapshot space and governance discussions within the #council-chambers will include these EIPs.

### Rationale

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

There have been a number of discussions around when to transition EIPs to the Elysian Council, this EIP has been proposed as a standalone vote as opposed to EIP-93/EIP-104 which tied this decision into other changes to the protocol. Given the importance of this change, it is ideal to isolate it from any other decisions and address it as a separate EIP. The changes proposed to the governance process in EIP-104 are still approved but would no longer be a dependency for this change.

### Technical Specification

<!--The technical specification should outline the public API of the changes proposed. That is, changes to any of the interfaces Elysian currently exposes or the creations of new ones.-->

All EIPs that are created on the EIP GitHub repo will need to be accompanied by a snapshot proposal on https://gov.elysian.finance/.

In addition, prior to a proposal being uploaded to gov.elysian.finance a EIP presentation must be held and attended by the EIP author, core contributors assigned to implement the EIP and at least 50% of the council. This presentation will use Discord voice chat to allow anon members to participate. It will provide a forum for any considerations and issues arising from the EIP to be interrogated and raised prior to a formal vote by the Council.

If this EIP is successful, it will be the last EIP to be voted via the legacy discord governance system. This means that this EIP will still be voted on the #governance-poll discord channel.

### Test Cases

<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for EIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->

### Configurable Values (Via ECCP)

<!--Please list all values configurable via ECCP under this implementation.-->
