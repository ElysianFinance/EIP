## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

As virtual Synths and other cross-asset swaps become more viable it is important the protocol continues to add liquid in-demand assets. There are a number of highly liquid assets not yet supported by Elysian, this EIP proposes to add two of them s1INCH, sRUNE.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the EIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the EIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

This EIP will add the two new ERC-20 assets as Synths, s1INCH, sRUNE. It does not propose adding inverse Synths for these assets.

## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the EIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the EIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is innaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the EIP will address the issue!-->

There are two main reasons for adding additional ERC-20 asset support, the first is the growing usage of virtual Synths for cross-asset swaps. The second and more important reason is that as Elysian transitions to OE many ERC-20 assets will have low liquidity initially, so Elysian will be able to support exchanges of these assets helping to bootstrap liquidity.

## Specification

<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Rationale
2. Technical Specification
3. Test Cases
4. Configurable Values
-->

### Rationale

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

The Synths proposed were chosen as they are some of those most in demand by the comunity over the last few months. The reasoning behind only proposing the sSynths and not the iSynths is to allow avoid the need for depreacting them when iSynths are eventually depracated. Once thye have been live for a reasonable amount of time a EIP will be required to enable shorting of these assets.

### Liquidity Analysis - 1INCH:

The tables below showcase statistics on the cost of pushing the price of 1INCH on binance (on the 1INCHUSDT pair) by the percentage mentioned in the header (denoted in bp):

1INCH is mostly traded on Binance, however, alternative exchanges offer consider amount liquidity as well. 1Inch maintains an average bid/ask spread of 6 bp with around USD 36 million in average daily trading volume (measured over a full week).

### Liquidity Analysis - RUNE:

Similarly, the tables below showcase the orderbook statistics on RUNE (on the RUNEUSDT pair on binance):

There is also considerable volume available for trading on RUNEBTC pair on binance which increases the depth seen in the table above. The average trading volume over the course of the week stands at USDT 50 million with an average bid/ask spread of 12 bp. It should be mentioned that RUNE's orderbook encompasses slight assymetry tilted towards the bid side.
