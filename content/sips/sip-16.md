## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the EIP.-->

Elysian upgrades take too long as the owner needs to make call upto 60 calls to configure the system.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.-->

Most of these calls are setElysian and setFeePool on all of the Synths. We propose to point the Synths to the
Elysian Proxy and FeePool Proxy.

## Motivation

<!--The motivation is critical for EIPs that want to change Elysian. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that the EIP solves. EIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

This would reduce the amount of time the system is offline. Making upgrades a lot faster, cheaper (gas) and minimize the impact on users with reduced downtime.

UPDATE: Since this requires redeploying all the Synths. We propose to also add redeploying all of the Synth Proxies with all the new [ProxyERC20.sol](https://github.com/elysianDAO/synthetix/blob/master/contracts/ProxyERC20.sol) to be able to support DEX integrations with all Synths. Currently only SNX and sETH have been updated to support the new [ProxyERC20.sol](https://github.com/elysianDAO/synthetix/blob/master/contracts/ProxyERC20.sol) for uniswap and Kyber integration. 

## Specification

<!--The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature.-->

### Old Implmentation:
Points directly to the underlying contract and needs to be set on each Synth each release. This is a growing number of calls as we add new synths. Currently 23 and more to come.

```javascript
bool isElysian = msg.sender == address(synthetix);
bool isFeePool = msg.sender == address(feePool);
```

### New Implmentation:
Utilizes the Proxy which should only be set once and rarley changed. This will however cost more gas for looking up the address.

```javascript
bool isElysian = msg.sender == address(Proxy(synthetixProxy).target());
bool isFeePool = msg.sender == address(Proxy(feePoolProxy).target());
```
      
## Rationale

<!--The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

## Test Cases

<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for EIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->

## Implementation

<!--The implementations must be completed before any EIP is given status "Implemented", but it need not be completed before the EIP is "Approved". While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of "rough consensus and running code" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.-->
