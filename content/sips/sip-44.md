## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the EIP.-->

Add a new `SystemStatus` contract to allow both synth pausing and system upgrades, as well as other security measures.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.-->

A `SystemStatus` contract can hold various types of state for system events. These include: system upgrades, issuance and exchange controls, and synths disabled due to security concerns, or in the short term, suspended during out-of-trading hours for the underlying asset.

## Motivation

<!--The motivation is critical for EIPs that want to change Elysian. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that the EIP solves. EIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

There are a number of conditions where the Elysian system needs to be able to pause. These are as follows:

1. **During upgrades**: Currently we have a workaround to disable the entire protocol by setting `ExchangeRates.rateIsStale` period to `1`. This is fairly rudimentary and needs improvement. Moreover a better reject reason will go a ways towards helping users address concerns during these windows.
2. **Security meaures**: There have been occasions where synths have needed to be disabled immediately, such as during the attack on sMKR and iMKR (see [EIP-34](./eip-34.md)). This gives the team and community time to investigate the situation and determine the next steps with minimal impact to the rest of the system. Moreover, we're continuing to build live monitoring software that can detect and disable synths whenever an attack is launched.

## Specification

<!--The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature.-->

The following areas can be suspended:

1. **System**: All synth and SNX transfers disabled. All exchange, issue, burn, claim, loan and mint functionality disabled. This is both for system upgrades and under possible emergency situations.
2. **Issuance**: All sUSD issuance, burning and claiming disabled, along with any loan actions.
3. **Exchange**: All synth exchanges.
4. **Synth**: For the synth in question, all transfers of, settlement of, and exchanges into or out of disabled.

Access to the above controls will be restricted to an `accessControlList`, a whitelist of addresses that for each section above, can `suspend` and/or `resume`. This whitelist will be managed by the `owner`.

Furthermore, each suspension must include a `uint reason`. Apart from the single reason `1` for `SYSTEM_UPGRADE`, these reasons are purely for dApps and scripts to indicate to users why certain parts of the system are unavailable.

> Note: **Exchange** suspension will remove `Exchange.exchangeEnabled` functionality and this EIP will remove it.

## Rationale

<!--The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

The Access Control allows the `owner` to configure the right kind of emergency system pause access to a range of manual and automated protection mechanism if anomalies or exploits are detected.

## Test Cases

<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for EIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->

## Implementation

<!--The implementations must be completed before any EIP is given status "Implemented", but it need not be completed before the EIP is "Approved". While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of "rough consensus and running code" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.-->
