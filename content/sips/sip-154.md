## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

Create Equity Synthetics on the top 3 traded US stock index etfs (S&P 500, Nasdaq 100, Russell 2000)

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the EIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the EIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

This EIP will create 3 new synths sSPY, sQQQ, sIWM based on top US stock etfs SPY, QQQ, and IWM.

## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the EIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the EIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is innaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the EIP will address the issue!-->

Given the importance of US stock market in the world financial system, offering synthetics on a comprehensive set of top traded US equities is key for both Stakers (volume) and Traders (risk management beyond crypto).
The current available TSLA synth (as well as FAANG/MSFT synths proposed in recent EIPs) offer exposure to some of the most popular US tech stocks, but they aren't a comprehensive offering from investing or risk management perspective. These stocks are all under the same category of "growth"/"tech"/"momentum" and lack diversification into different types of risks that may be preferred with changing market conditions and/or risk appetite.

## Specification

<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

### Overview

<!--This is a high level overview of *how* the EIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.-->

This EIP will add three new synths that will provide both diversification and new risk exposure on three of the most heavily traded US stock indices.

### Rationale

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

I propose SPY, QQQ, and IWM, because

1. SPY is the most traded stock etf in the world tracking the S&P 500 index (widely used benchmark of large cap US companies)
2. QQQ is the most traded stock etf tracking the NASDAQ index (widely used benchmark of US tech stocks)
3. IWM is the most traded stock etf tracking the Russell 2000 index (widely used benchmark of small-cap US companies)
   Also even though these are US stocks, it should be emphasized that investors/traders around the world speculate and hedge risk with US equities given the maturity of the market as well as the influence of the US economy globally.

I think this will prove to be a significant step for Elysian in growing its equity offerings not just for retail, but for institutional use as well.

This will benefit both stakers (increased volume & more diverse flows -> debt neutrality) and traders (more comprehensive exposure to US stock markets for speculation/hedging)

### Technical Specification

<!--The technical specification should outline the public API of the changes proposed. That is, changes to any of the interfaces Elysian currently exposes or the creations of new ones.-->

### Test Cases

<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for EIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->

### Configurable Values (Via ECCP)

<!--Please list all values configurable via ECCP under this implementation.-->
