## Simple Summary

This EIP proposes to track and record the fees paid by each address during each fee period to enable the distribution of trading incentives from a pool of SNX.

## Abstract

The exchanger contract will be updated to write to a Trading Rewards contract after each succesful exchange. The Trading Rewards contract will be a simpler version of the Staking Rewards contract, each time fees are paid in an exchange, the balance of fees paid will be recorded in the Trading Rewards contract. SNX will be deposited manually each fee period into this contract, and traders will earn a portion of this SNX, as they pay trading fees.

## Motivation

There is currently no way to track trading fees paid on-chain, so it is not possible to reward traders who pay more fees on the exchange. Paying fee rebates is a very powerful way of reducing friction, and switching costs for new traders. However, where CEX's can identify users and pay onboarding fees and other incentives, a DEX does not have this ability, so using a pooled mechanism rather than a direct rebate per user ensures the total fee incentive does not exceed a specified amount and cannot be sybil attacked. The pooled mechanism also ensures that traders who trade earlier are rewarded more than later traders, incentivising traders to test out the exchange sooner. While the sX trading experience has improved significantly, there is still friction due to latency and other limitations. While we fully expect these limitations to be reduced or eliminated entirely in the near future, attracting new traders is critical to the growth of the platform. The trading experience is now sufficiently differentiated that the experience is likely to be positive relative to other DEX's, particularly with respect to slippage and fees. This pooled mechanism also introduces the ability to add referal incentives and other mechanism if the base incentive proves successful.

## Specification

<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections

2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification

5. Configurable Values
-->

### Overview

Exchanger will be modified to write to a Trading Rewards contract each time a trade is completed. The function will check the total fees paid in that fee period, and add the additional fees paid in that exchange to this balance.

This fee balance will be used to calculate the distribution of the SNX during that period. At the end of the period, the balance will need to be reset for each address and fees will begin to accumulate again. Balances will be zeroed when the new SNX is deposited from the inflationary supply or manually during the trial period.

### Rationale

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

We considered a number of approaches to this problem, including minting fee tokens and paying incentives immediately on each trade. There are several benefits to this approach over the alternatives considered. The first is that users can accumulate as many fees as they want before claiming, reducing gas costs, and allowing even small traders to wait until they have sufficient fees to justify a withdrawal. Secondly this negates the requirement of handling fee period rollovers, or unclaimed fees as trading incentives are not dependent on feepool periods. Each week the balanance of fees paid is wiped when the new SNX deposit is made, ensuring all traders start each fee period with an equal chance to earn fees.

**Trading Rewards Contract**

When an exchange is made by a user on Elysian Exchange, the amount of fees remitted (in sUSD) and the user the funds are exchanged `from` will be recorded in the `Trading incentive contract`.

The total exchange fees an `address` generates during a period (tracked via `periodID`) will be accumulated. The counter is reset when SNX for the incentives is deposited for the period and a user makes another trade. The accumulated total fees of the previous period will be stored on the next trade, regardless of how long ago the last trade was.

For exchanges occuring through integrations, and exchange aggregators such as `1inch` there will be a function that allows an `address` to be passed through the exchange to be recorded against the originating address for the trading volume incentives.

The `TradingRewards` contract will track the `recordedFees` for each period generated by exchanges, which will be used for calculating the % of the fees an account has generated in that period, and hence the % of the SNX rewards they will be allocated.

The SNX rewards an account can claim for a period is calculated as:

\\[ reward = \frac{Account's Exchange Fees for period}{Total Exchange Fees for period} * SNX rewards for period
\\]

The `recordedFees` will be stored and kept for each period once the new SNX is deposited for that period and closes it, resetting the balances for the next period to accumulate.

This allows the account's to claim their trading incentives in any period they want in the future, and combining multiple periods to claim.

**Interface**

```
pragma solidity >=0.4.24;

interface ITradingRewards {
  // Views
  function getAvailableRewardsForAccountForPeriod(address account, uint periodID) external view returns (uint);

  function getAvailableRewardsForAccountForPeriods(address account, uint[] calldata periodIDs)
      external
      view
      returns (uint totalRewards);

  // Mutative Functions
  function recordExchangeFeeForAccount(uint usdFeeAmount, address account) external;

  function claimRewardsForPeriod(uint periodID) external;

  function claimRewardsForPeriods(uint[] calldata periodIDs) external;

  // Owner only
  function closeCurrentPeriodWithRewards(uint rewards) external;
}
```

**Exchanger contract**

Remit exchange fees generated by an account to the `TradingRewards` contract, storing the total fees for each account in the contract.

Originator - A function to allow trading incentives to be recorded against any `address` instead of the `msg.sender` of the `synthetix.exchangeWithTracking()` transaction. It is intended to allow tracking and allocating rewards to the originating address if they are trading via DEXs and contracts. The `address` will need to be the one claiming the rewards from the `TradingRewards` contract.

**Exchange Partner Volume Tracking**

Partner exchanges such as `https://1inch.exchange/` who allow trading Synths on their frontend platform will be able to earn partner volume rewards that is paid separately by the Elysian DAO.

In order to support and integrate partner exchange volume tracking, the `Elysian.exchangeWithTracking` function will allow partner exchanges to pass in their unique tracking code (for the partner volume tracking) and also the `originator` address that will be able to track the originating trader's individual address.

The `partnerCode` will be emitted as an event with the fee volume amount of the exchange. If it isn't set (i.e, no partner code as input), it will be left out and no event is emitted.

**interfaces**

```
interface IElysian {
  function exchangeWithTracking(
      bytes32 sourceCurrencyKey,
      uint sourceAmount,
      bytes32 destinationCurrencyKey
      address originator
      bytes32 trackingCode
  ) external returns (uint amountReceived);

  function exchangeOnBehalfWithTracking(
      address exchangeForAddress,
      bytes32 sourceCurrencyKey,
      uint sourceAmount,
      bytes32 destinationCurrencyKey,
      address originator,
      bytes32 trackingCode
  ) external returns (uint amountReceived);
}
```

```
interface IExchanger {
  function exchangeWithTracking(
      address from,
      bytes32 sourceCurrencyKey,
      uint sourceAmount,
      bytes32 destinationCurrencyKey,
      address destinationAddress,
      address originator,
      bytes32 trackingCode
  ) external returns (uint amountReceived);

  function exchangeOnBehalfWithTracking(
      address exchangeForAddress,
      address from,
      bytes32 sourceCurrencyKey,
      uint sourceAmount,
      bytes32 destinationCurrencyKey,
      address originator,
      bytes32 trackingCode
  ) external returns (uint amountReceived);
}
```

### Test Cases

<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for EIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->

- When an exchange is made, the exchange fee in sUSD and the address the exchange `from` gets stored in the trading incentives contract and the `recordedFees` for the period is increased by the exchange fee amount.
- When a delegatedExchange is made, the exchange fee in sUSD and the address the exchange `from` gets stored in the trading incentives contract and the `recordedFees` in the period is increased by the exchange fee amount.
- When an exchange is made, the exchange fee is added to the `unaccountedFeesForAccount` for the account, a value accumulated for the period until it is closed.
- When an exchange is made, if the account last made a trade in a previous period, it will store their `recordedFees` for the previous period and reset the value for the current period.
- When an exchange is made, if an address is passed in to record the trading incentives for, then it will store the total fees against that address.
- Given a referral address is sent in an exchange, the referral address will be recorded on the trading incentives contract and the exchange fees attributed to it.

**Finalising Period**

Given the Trading Rewards contract has a balance of 10,000 SNX, the `totalRewards` is 10,000, and current periodID is 2.

Given the following preconditions:

- Another 10,000 SNX is transferred to the Trading Rewards contract
- The contract balance is 20,000 SNX

---

- When `closeCurrentPeriodWithRewards` is called with another 10,000 SNX

Then

- ✅ It succeeds and `totalRewards` is increased by 10,000 to 20,000 SNX
- ✅ The transaction will record the `recordedFees` for the current period (Period 2) and reset it.
- ✅ It will also increment the `periodID` to periodID = 3.

---

Given

- Another 5000 SNX is transferred to the Trading Rewards contract
- The contract balance is 25,000 SNX

---

- When `closeCurrentPeriodWithRewards` is called with another 10,000 SNX

Then

- ❌ It fails as the `totalRewards !== balanceOf(address(this))` after it increases to 30,000.

**Reward Claiming**

Given Alice has generated 1000 sUSD of exchange fees in the past month, and the total exchange fees for the period is 10,000 sUSD,

Given the following preconditions:

- SNX reward for the last month is 10,000 SNX
- PeriodID was 1 and current periodID is 2

---

- When Alice claims her rewards for the periodID(1)

Then

- ✅ the `unaccountedFeesForAccount` for Alice in period 1 is recorded and her current `unaccountedFeesForAccount` is reset to 0.
- ✅ her portion of the rewards is 1000 SNX for the month.
- ✅ the period is marked claimed for the user.
- ✅ the `availableRewards` value is decreased by 1000 SNX.

---

- When Alice tries to claim her rewards for the periodID(1) again

Then

- ❌ It fails as Alice already claimed for the period

---

- When Alice tries to claim for period 2

Then

- ❌ It fails as the current period is period 2 and still open

---

Given Alice has made no trades in Period 2 and it is now closed after SNX rewards are sent

- When Alice tries to claim for period 2

Then

- ❌ It fails as she has no rewards payable as her `unaccountedFeesForAccount` is 0.
