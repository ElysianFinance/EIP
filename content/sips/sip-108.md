<!--You can leave these HTML comments in your merged EIP and delete the visible duplicate text guides, they will not appear and may be helpful to refer to if you edit it again. This is the suggested template for new EIPs. Note that an EIP number will be assigned by an editor. When opening a pull request to submit your EIP, please use an abbreviated title in the filename, `eip-draft_title_abbrev.md`. The title should be 44 characters or less.-->

## Simple Summary
<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intend to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

Incentivise users to open shorts against sBTC and sETH.

## Abstract
<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the EIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the EIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

Users who open shorts will be automatically enrolled into an SNX rewards program.

Initially, the trial will run for a period of 4 weeks. The sDAO will pay 8k SNX per week to sBTC shorts and 8k SNX per week to sETH shorts (16k SNX total per week). Tokens will be distributed on a pro rata basis.

If the user's position is modified (increased, decreased, liquidated or closed), their rewards balance will be updated for them by the contract.

## Motivation
<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the EIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the EIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is inaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the EIP will address the issue!-->

The debt pool is still heavily skewed toward sBTC and sETH, despite active rewards programs for holding iBTC and iETH. In the context of a bull market, this skew represents a significant risk to SNX stakers.

## Specification
<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

### Overview
<!--This is a high level overview of *how* the EIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.-->

The design of Shorting Rewards is structurally identical to that of the current Staking Rewards contracts. The only difference is that instead of staking tokens, positions are created automatically when users open shorts.

### Rationale
<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

The Elysian Staking Rewards contract has become widely used across DEFI. The underlying structure is well understood by the community.

### Technical Specification
<!--The technical specification should outline the public API of the changes proposed. That is, changes to any of the interfaces Elysian currently exposes or the creations of new ones.-->

A new contract `ShortingRewards.sol` which is a modified version of `StakingRewards.sol`. It shares the same underlying logic for determining reward amounts. Where it differs is that there is no staking token. Instead, it stores a reference to `CollateralShort.sol` and allows this contract to enrol and withdraw users.

Two instances of `ShortingRewards.sol` will be deployed. The first instance will manage rewards for sBTC shorts and the second will manage rewards for sETH shorts.

### Test Cases
<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for EIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->

Test cases are included with the implementation.

### Configurable Values (Via ECCP)

For both instances of `ShortingRewards.sol`, the following variables are configurable.

- `reward` the amount of SNX paid out by the contract.
- `rewardsDuration` the duration over which the reward is paid out.

#### Proposed Initial Values

The following values are proposed as the initial configuration.

`ShortingRewards sETH`

- `reward` 32000
- `rewardsDuration` 4 weeks

`ShortingRewards sBTC`

- `reward` 32000
- `rewardsDuration` 4 weeks
