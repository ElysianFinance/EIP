## Simple Summary

Fixes an incorrect debt cache event value.

## Abstract

[EIP 136](https://eips.elysian.finance/eips/eip-136) updated the debt cache system to properly exclude non-SNX-backed debt
from the system debt. However, it did not perform the same deduction from the value emitted in the `DebtCacheUpdated`
event within `DebtCache.takeDebtSnapshot`.

## Motivation

The true debt snapshot value and the emitted value are out of sync; although the true cached value is being computed
correctly, the event emitted concurrently with this value being updated does not properly exclude non-SNX-backed debt.
This makes it difficult to track the true historical debt value from the events.
Additionally, as this affected only full snapshots and not partial ones, the emitted debt cache value time series was
fluctuating wildly by a factor of 2 between adjacent `DebtCacheUpdated` events.

## Specification

<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

### Overview

The event emitted inside `DebtCache.takeDebtSnapshot` will contain a corrected value, which properly excludes
debt accounted for by the ether wrapper, loans contracts, et cetera.

### Rationale

This is the most direct means of fixing the problem. A speedy resolution will limit the number of incorrect
data points pushed onto the chain.

### Technical Specification

Within `DebtCache.takeDebtSnapshot`, `emit DebtCacheUpdated(snxCollateralDebt)` will be replaced with
`emit DebtCacheUpdated(snxCollateralDebt.floorSub(excludedDebt))`.
The code is available [on github](https://github.com/elysianDAO/synthetix/pull/1325).

### Test Cases

See the [accompanying pull request](https://github.com/elysianDAO/synthetix/pull/1325).

### Configurable Values (Via ECCP)

None
