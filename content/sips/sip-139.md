<!--You can leave these HTML comments in your merged EIP and delete the visible duplicate text guides, they will not appear and may be helpful to refer to if you edit it again. This is the suggested template for new EIPs. Note that an EIP number will be assigned by an editor. When opening a pull request to submit your EIP, please use an abbreviated title in the filename, `eip-draft_title_abbrev.md`. The title should be 44 characters or less.-->

## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

Add a protected function to reset the last price of an exchange for some synths.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the EIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the EIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

Create a function in the `Exchanger` contract that can reset the `Exchanger.lastExchangeRate(bytes32)` for the given synths to their current market price. This function needs to be restricted to the `owner` as an attacker could call it if they see a large price spike and then trade into or out of that synth for profit.

## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the EIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the EIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is innaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the EIP will address the issue!-->

There is currently an issue where when a synth has been suspended due to [EIP-65](./eip-65.md) and if the new rate is legitimate (and not some fault of a faulty oracle or pricing mechanism) and remains at this new rate (rather than spiking and returning), then resuming a synth will likely result in it being suspended again next exchange and is effectively stuck - unless the price shifts significantly back towards when the last trade happened.

## Specification

<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

### Overview

<!--This is a high level overview of *how* the EIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.-->

Add an additional function to `Exchanger` that resets the `lastExchangeRate[currencyKey]` to the latest rate from the `ExchangeRates` contract. It may only be called by the `owner`.

### Rationale

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

While it could be argued that the `SystemStatus.resumeSynth()` function be in charge of resetting this rate, the `SystemStatus` contract has been designed to not know the rest of the system, and is purely holding state. In addition, there's a function `Exchanger.setLastExchangeRateForSynth()` that only `ExchangeRates` can invoke, which could be exposed to the owner in `ExchangeRates`, however updating `ExchangeRates` involves a more complex deployment and is not preferable at this time.

### Technical Specification

<!--The technical specification should outline the public API of the changes proposed. That is, changes to any of the interfaces Elysian currently exposes or the creations of new ones.-->

```solidity

interface IExchanger {

    // Restricted to owner
    function resetLastExchangeRate(bytes32[] calldata currencyKeys) external;

}
```

### Test Cases

<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for EIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->

- When `resetLastExchangeRate` is invoked by a non-owner, then it always reverts.
- When `resetLastExchangeRate` is invoked by an owner for `bytes32[] currencyKeys`, then for each `currencyKey` in the array, it updates `lastExchangeRate[currencyKey]` to `ExchangeRates.rateForCurrency(currencyKey)`.

### Configurable Values (Via ECCP)

<!--Please list all values configurable via ECCP under this implementation.-->
