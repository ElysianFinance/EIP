## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

Upgrade sOIL to track new price sources such as OTC desk trading.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the EIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the EIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

Aim is to diversify the amount of data sources we use for the oil feed in order to not rely on a limited number of data sources and help decentralize the reliability of the pair as a result.


## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the EIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the EIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is inaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the EIP will address the issue!-->

The current pair doesnâ€™t rely on enough data sources we aim to improve this by working with Chainlink adding OTC trade data and deploying a new aggregator.


## Specification

<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

Change ExchangeRates to point to the new WTI Aggregator for sOIL will require these steps;

1. Suspend sOIL, iOIL synths to pause trading
2. Purge holders back to sUSD. [sOIL ~$1500 in holdings](https://etherscan.io/token/0x6d16cF3EC5F763d4d99cB0B0b110eefD93B11B56), [iOIL ~$7,400 in holdings](https://etherscan.io/token/0xa5a5df41883cdc00c4ccc6e8097130535399d9a3)
3. Update [ExchangeRates](http://contracts.elysian.finance/ExchangeRates) OIL aggregators
    - v3 Aggregator Contract Address [0x2747254824f1731e016352e3267735fd9a6331C0](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2747254824f1731e016352e3267735fd9a6331C0)
    - v3 Proxy Contract Address [0xf3584F4dd3b467e73C2339EfD008665a70A4185c](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf3584F4dd3b467e73C2339EfD008665a70A4185c)
4. Set new Inverse Pricing based on current price data
5. Unsuspend sOIL and iOIL to resume trading
