<!--You can leave these HTML comments in your merged EIP and delete the visible duplicate text guides, they will not appear and may be helpful to refer to if you edit it again. This is the suggested template for new EIPs. Note that an EIP number will be assigned by an editor. When opening a pull request to submit your EIP, please use an abbreviated title in the filename, `eip-draft_title_abbrev.md`. The title should be 44 characters or less.-->

## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the EIP.-->

Add new long and inverse Synths for three new cryptocurrencies: Chainlink (LINK), Ripple (XRP), and Litecoin (LTC).

## Motivation

<!--The motivation is critical for EIPs that want to change Elysian. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that the EIP solves. EIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

Adding long/inverse exposure to a range of new crypto Synths will allow traders to speculate on the value of some of the best-known tokens in the ecosystem. This update is intended to attract more traders to Elysian.Exchange, adding to the growing list of available Synths. It's important to attract new traders to the platform, because the entire protocol is built around rewarding SNX stakers with fees generated by trding volume. 

## Specification

<!--The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature.-->

These Synths will be implemented in much the same way as the other long/Inverse crypto Synths. Each Inverse Synth will have an entry price, as well as upper and lower thresholds. If the iSynths reach their upper or lower thresholds, they will be frozen, holders will be purged into sUSD, and they will be added to the system once again. 

## Rationale

<!--The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

These cryptocurrencies were chosen through community voting on Twitter, demonstrating that there is already some demand in the community to trade these assets. 

## Test Cases

<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for EIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->

N/A

## Implementation

<!--The implementations must be completed before any EIP is given status "Implemented", but it need not be completed before the EIP is "Approved". While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of "rough consensus and running code" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.-->

These Synths will be added in the upcoming [Arcturus release](https://blog.elysian.finance/the-arcturus-release/).
