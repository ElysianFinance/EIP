<!--You can leave these HTML comments in your merged EIP and delete the visible duplicate text guides, they will not appear and may be helpful to refer to if you edit it again. This is the suggested template for new EIPs. Note that an EIP number will be assigned by an editor. When opening a pull request to submit your EIP, please use an abbreviated title in the filename, `eip-draft_title_abbrev.md`. The title should be 44 characters or less.-->

## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the EIP.-->

Add new long and inverse Synths for six new cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Cardano (ADA), Dash, EOS, Monero (XMR), Ethereum Classic (ETC).
Add new long and inverse Synths for two new indices: FTSE 100 Index, Nikkei 225 Index
Add new long and inverse Synths for one new commodity: Brent Crude Oil

## Motivation

<!--The motivation is critical for EIPs that want to change Elysian. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that the EIP solves. EIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

Adding long/inverse exposure to a range of new Synths will allow traders to profit from bullish or bearish bets on the value of some of the best-known assets in the ecosystem.

## Specification

<!--The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature.-->

These Synths will be implemented in much the same way as the other long/inverse crypto Synths. Each Synth will have upper and lower thresholds.

## Rationale

<!--The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

Additional crypto, indices and Brent Crude Oil synths will add further utility to Elysian.Exchange. The included cryptocurrencies were chosen based on the new report by Delphi Digital, indices and Brent Crude Oil were chosen based on community demand and poll in Discord.

## Test Cases

<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for EIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->

TBC

## Implementation

<!--The implementations must be completed before any EIP is given status "Implemented", but it need not be completed before the EIP is "Approved". While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of "rough consensus and running code" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.-->

These Synths will be added in the upcoming Hadar release.
