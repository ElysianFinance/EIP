## Implementors

Mark E. Barrasso (@barrasso), Daniel Beal (@KillerByte)

## Simple Summary

Allows users to wrap any ERC20 token and mint its synthetic counterpart

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the EIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the EIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

This EIP proposes to create a new `WrapperFactory` contract that can deploy new `Wrapper` contracts to support virtually any ERC20 token. The new `Wrapper` contract behaves just like its predecessor, the `ETH Wrappr` from [EIP-112](eip-112.md).

## Motivation

With respect to adding support for more token wrappers, this EIP proposes a new abstract factory contract that can deploy new wrappers as needed rather than creating another distinct EIP and contract for each new token to be added in the future.

## Specification

<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

### Overview

<!--This is a high level overview of *how* the EIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.-->

A new contract is created, `WrapperFactory`, which deploys `Wrapper` instances. Before a new `Wrapper` instance can be deployed, it must first be approved via EIP. A synthetic token is minted whenever a user deposits a supported ERC20 token into its respective `Wrapper`. The user can deposit any amount desired however, this is subject to not exceeding the `maxTokenAmount`, which is configurable via ECCP. There is no duration, interest rate or collateralization ratio, as any user can at any time buy back the ERC20 token available in the contract by burning the synthetic token. SNX stakers benefit as minting and burning are subject to a `mintingFeeRate` and `burningFeeRate`, both of which are paid to the fee pool after conversion into sUSD. The `WrapperFactory` contract supports wrapper deployment for virtually any ERC20 token, and `Wrapper` automatically handles wrapping/unwrapping of the token for the user.

### Rationale

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

This EIP makes it easier to deploy `Wrapper` contracts that can support more assets in the future and will help expand the total supply of synths.

### Technical Specification

<!--The technical specification should outline the public API of the changes proposed. That is, changes to any of the interfaces Elysian currently exposes or the creations of new ones.-->

#### WrapperFactory

A new Elysian core contract is created, `WrapperFactory`, which by means of the factory pattern deploys `Wrapper` instances using `createWrapper`. The `WrapperFactory` assumes functionality previously exposed by `EtherWrapper`.

Specifically, `WrapperFactory` contains the following functions:

- `createWrapper(IERC20 token, bytes32 currencyKey, bytes32 synthContractName)`
  - Allows `owner` to create `Wrapper` contracts. `token` and `currencyKey` indicate which token and synth should be wrapped, and `synthContractName` is included because concatenation of `bytes32` strings within solidity is difficult, and should match the `AddressResolver` name of the contract for `currencyKey`.
- `isWrapper(address possibleWrapper) returns (bool)`
  - Allows Elysian system components to verify a valid Wrapper contract by passing contract address. Returns boolean, indicating if its a Wrapper contract or not
- `distributeFees()`
  - Assumes functionality of `EtherWrapper.distributeFees`, sending fees to the fee pool and informing of status
  - _note small change in functionality_ fees are returned from sUSD instead of source currency keys. This means there is no debt hedging, but much easier to develop code for

#### Wrapper

The Wrapper created by the factory should be functionally equivalent to [EIP-112](eip-112.md), with the following exceptions:

- Constructor accepts IERC20 token address `token` of source token, and currency key `currencyKey` of target synth
- `sETHIssued` renamed to `synthIssued`
- `maxETH` renamed to `maxTokenAmount`
- `SystemSettings` values have additional `wrapperAddress` argument to match
- Upon `_mint` or `_burn`, equivalent value sUSD is minted into the `WrapperFactory` contract instead of withholding `sETH`. This is functionally different in that fees are held as `sUSD` instead of their matching synth, meaning there is no hedging for the period of time before synth distribution.
- `distributeFees` removed

`EtherWrapper` and `NativeEtherWrapper` are deprecated.

#### DebtCache

In order to optimize for gas usage and improve gas calculation

The new functions are added:

- `recordExcludedDebtChange(bytes32 currencyKey, int256 delta) external`
  - only callable by "Debt issuers" (which for now is just `Wrapper` instances)
  - updates the `excludedDebt` entry for
  - for this function to work properly it is critical that all debt changes for reporters be reported here
- `excludedIssuedDebts(bytes32[] memory currencyKeys) external view returns (uint256[])`
  - returns excludedIssuedDebt values for supplied currencyKeys
- `takeDebtSnapshot()`
  - modified to subtract `excludedDebt` entries from its total debt calculation

#### SystemSettings

External functions are added to match settings described in the `Configurable Values` section below. Of particular note, the `mintRate` and `burnRate`
configurabale params will now have the ability to specify a negative value (type will be `int256` instead of `uint256`), effectively incentivising rapid burn or minting of debt if the situation
calls for the need. If `mintRate` is set to -0.5, for example, the user will receive 0.5% more sETH than the ETH they put in. The reverse is true for `burnRate`--
the user will receive 0.5% more ETH when they burn the corresponding amount of sETH.

#### Special Concerns

It is possible that the `SystemSettings` contract will not fit on L2.

### Test Cases

<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for EIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->

Wrapper initialized with WETH -> sETH

- Given that a user has `e` amount of ETH and `ew` WETH and the contract has `c` amount of ETH in spare capacity
  - Given that `ew` is larger than or equal to `c`
    - When the user attempts to deposit `e` ETH into the contract

  - ❌ The transaction reverts due to the user minting with both `WETH` and `ETH`

### Configurable Values (Via ECCP)

<!--Please list all values configurable via ECCP under this implementation.-->

There are 3 new values for each Wrapper created by the WrapperFactory:

| Name                    | Setter                     | Description                                                                                             |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `wrapperMaxTokenAmount` | `setWrapperMaxTokenAmount` | Maximum number of tokens in custody of the wrapper                                                      |
| `wrapperMintFeeRate`    | `setWrapperMintFeeRate`    | Portion of synths after minting to be withheld for delivery to fee pool. This value may be negative.    |
| `wrapperBurnFeeRate`    | `setWrapperBurnFeeRate`    | Portion of synths prior to burning to be withheld for delivery to fee pool. This value may be negative. |

For all of the above parameters, the corresponding setter or getter function must be supplied with `wrapperAddress` to indicate which wrapper should be applied the setting.

In addition, `etherWrapperMaxETH`, `etherWrapperMintFeeRate`, and `etherWrapperBurnFeeRate` are deprecated.
