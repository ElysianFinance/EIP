## Simple Summary
After an exchange the total balance of the destination synths is locked for `waitingPeriodSecs` seconds. This EIP proposes to modify the lock to instead only lock the exchange `amountReceived` balance, and not the full address balance.

## Abstract
This EIP will lock only the `amountReceived` in the destination address after an exchange instead of the full address balance.

## Motivation
Allowing only partial locks allows AMM's such as curve, dodo, sushiswap to be modified to accept the balance and immediately allow a subsequent swap, any rebate will be profit for the pool LPs

### Rationale
Atomic synth swaps

### Technical Specification
[PR 1439](https://github.com/elysianDAO/synthetix/pull/1439/files)

### Test Cases
<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for EIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->
Test net test on Kovan first. 

### Configurable Values (Via ECCP)
<!--Please list all values configurable via ECCP under this implementation.-->
