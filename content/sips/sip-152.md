## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intend to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

This EIP proposes to fix up a bug identified in the contracts introduced by [EIP-104](./eip-104.md) "Elysian Council Dilution", in the current contracts, when a new election is logged, dApps are unable to access historical election data.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the EIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the EIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

This proposal will redeploy the fixed version of [Elysian: Elysian Council Dilution](https://etherscan.io/address/0x30Ba359FE295E311D24BcCb1502c7a6e89Fb2100) which will allow dApps to access previous election data, especially when dealing with EIPs/ECCPs voted on by ex-council members.

## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the EIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the EIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is inaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the EIP will address the issue!-->

For the Elysian Council Dilution contract to work successfully, it needs to show the correct dilution weight NOT only for current proposals created within the election epoch but for proposals made in previous election epochs.

## Specification

<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

### Overview

<!--This is a high level overview of *how* the EIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.-->

This EIP documents the changes made to the contract that will solve this issue. Although it is a small code change, this EIP aims to track the context of Elysian Council Dilution changes.

### Rationale

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

After the first election epoch concluded, the Staking dApp's (staking.elysian.finance) governance page was experiencing troubles loading up the EIP/ECCP previous created. Upon investigation, it was found that the contract had some incorrect logic in one of the non-mutative functions. Since this is an error that can cause issues later if not fixed, I propose to fix this function.

Since historical data such as the number of votes of a council member, is stored in the contract via `ElectionLog`, the most simple and effective way to get previous data was to map `ProposalLog` to the `electionHash` of the election epoch that was active when the proposal was created. This then allows the view function to access historical voting data.

### Technical Specification

<!--The technical specification should outline the public API of the changes proposed. That is, changes to any of the interfaces Elysian currently exposes or the creations of new ones.-->

The failing line in the non-mutative function called `getDilutedWeightForProposal` would not return the weight if the `councilMember` passed in was not a current council member anymore

```
function getDilutedWeightForProposal(string memory proposalHash, address councilMember) public view returns (uint) {
    require(
            electionHashToLog[latestElectionHash].councilMembers[councilMember],
            "address must be a nominated council member"
        );
    }
```

The proposed fixes

- Adding the `electionHash` when a proposal is created so we can access the election epoch in which a proposal was created within

```
    struct ProposalLog {
        // @notice The ipfs hash of a particular ECCP/EIP proposal
        string proposalHash;
        // @notice The election hash of the current epoch when the proposal was made
        string electionHash;
        //  @notice The timestamp which the voting period begins
        uint start;
        // @notice The timestamp which the voting period of the proposal ends
        uint end;
        // @notice A boolean value to check whether a proposal log exists
        bool exist;
    }

```

- Adding in the `latestElectionHash` on proposal creation

```
    ProposalLog memory newProposalLog = ProposalLog(proposalHash, latestElectionHash, start, end, true);
```

- Modifiying the view function

```
    function getDilutedWeightForProposal(string memory proposalHash, address councilMember) public view returns (uint) {
        require(proposalHashToLog[proposalHash].exist, "proposal does not exist");

        string memory electionHash = proposalHashToLog[proposalHash].electionHash;

        require(electionHashToLog[electionHash].councilMembers[councilMember], "address must be a nominated council member");

        uint originalWeight = electionHashToLog[electionHash].votesForMember[councilMember];
        uint penaltyValue = proposalHashToMemberDilution[proposalHash][councilMember].totalDilutionValue;

        return (originalWeight - penaltyValue).divideDecimal(originalWeight);
    }
```

### Test Cases

<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for EIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->

Case 1:

1. Create an election
2. Create a proposal
3. Dilute the current council members
4. Get the diluted weight of the current council members
5. Log a new election with new council members
6. Get the diluted weight of the previous council members
7. Values 4. and 6. should equal and be accessible

### Configurable Values (Via ECCP)

<!--Please list all values configurable via ECCP under this implementation.-->
