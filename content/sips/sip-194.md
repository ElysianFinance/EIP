## Simple Summary

Ensure the `Elysian` contract on L2 can facilitate liquidations.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the EIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the EIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "We propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

The version of Elysian on L2 - `MintableElysian` - needs to forward requests from the public to the `Issuer` contract in order for liquidations to work as intended on L2.

## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the EIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the EIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is inaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the EIP will address the issue!-->

During the Menkalinan release, the `Issuer` contract was updated on L2 to align with L1, such that it could generate liquidations. However, the function in question `Issuer.liquidateDelinquentAccount()` can only be invoked by `Elysian` (in the case of L2 - `MintableElysian`) and this contract needed updating such that it can be publicly callable on L2.

## Specification

<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

### Overview

<!--This is a high level overview of *how* the EIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.-->

Move the `liquidateDelinquentAccount` logic from `Elysian` to `BaseElysian` along with the `AccountLiquidated` event definition.

### Rationale

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

As liquidations is supported on both layers, the logic belongs in the shared base contract of both L1 (`Elysian`) and L2 (`MintableElysian`), hence it will go into `BaseElysian`.

### Technical Specification

<!--The technical specification should outline the public API of the changes proposed. That is, changes to any of the interfaces Elysian currently exposes or the creations of new ones.-->

`IElysian` interface is unchanged, however after the upgrade, `IElysian.liquidateDelinquentAccount()` will no longer always revert with the unimplemented revert reason (`"Cannot be run on this layer"`).

### Test Cases

<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for EIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->

- Given an account has been flagged for liquidation on L2, and given the delay has elapsed since flagging, and given its cratio is still below the threshold, and given the user has sufficient sUSD to liquidate the account, when a user invokes liquidation on the account, then it succeeds

### Configurable Values (Via ECCP)

<!--Please list all values configurable via ECCP under this implementation.-->
