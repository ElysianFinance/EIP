## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

Moving CouncilDilution.sol to OVM creates a risk of being unable to vote on EIP and ECCP proposals (by normal means) if OVM becomes unavailable for some reason. Allowing (re-)deployment of CouncilDilution.sol to L1 in such cases ensures continued governance with little to no interruption. 

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the EIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the EIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "We propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

EIP-201 amends [EIP-191](https://eips.elysian.finance/eips/eip-191/) to allow (re-)deployment of CouncilDilution.sol on L1, in case OVM is unavailable or otherwise not usable by normal means to propose or vote on EIP and ECCP proposals.

## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the EIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the EIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is inaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the EIP will address the issue!-->

With [EIP-191](https://eips.elysian.finance/eips/eip-191/) the formerly on L1 deployed CouncilDilution.sol has been moved to OVM to reduce gas costs and speed up the governance process. However this opens governance up to being unusable (by normal means) in case of OVM becoming unavailable or otherwise unreasonably difficult to interact with, for example if the OVM sequencer fails.

By allowing (re-)deployment of CouncilDilution.sol to L1, the Elysian Council's ability to conduct proper governance gets preserved. If OVM truly becomes unavailable for a prolonged time, the likelihood for contentious governance votes is very high, so a proper governance platform has to be available on short notice, to ensure proper continuation of the governance process.

## Specification

<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

### Overview

<!--This is a high-level overview of *how* the EIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented-->

EIP-201 amends [EIP-191](https://eips.elysian.finance/eips/eip-191/) to allow (re-)deployment of CouncilDilution.sol on L1, in case OVM is unavailable or otherwise not usable by normal means to propose or vote on EIP and ECCP proposals.

### Rationale

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs? The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

[EIP-191](https://eips.elysian.finance/eips/eip-191/) was posted to Snapshot governance before the draft could be modified. By amending EIP-191 after it passed governance approval, this important backstop can be easily added retroactively without delaying the migration of CouncilDilution.sol to OVM.

### Technical Specification

If EIP-201 is approved, it will be considered a mandatory addition (amendment) to [EIP-191](https://eips.elysian.finance/eips/eip-191/).

### Configurable Values (Via ECCP)

<!--Please list all values configurable via ECCP under this implementation.-->
