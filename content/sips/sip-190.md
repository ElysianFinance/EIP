## Simple Summary

Adding a LUSD wrappr that mints 1 sUSD for each 1 LUSD deposited and releases 1 LUSD for each sUSD burned (excluding fees).

## Abstract

This EIP proposes to add the LUSD/sUSD wrappr using the wrappr factory specified in [EIP-182](https://eips.elysian.finance/eips/eip-182/).

## Motivation

The LUSD wrappr will allow us to reduce the negative ETH skew on the debt pool while keeping the peg in check on L1.

## Specification and Overview

The sUSD/LUSD wrappr will function similar to the LUSD/sUSD wrappr on L2, where a users can mint 1 sUSD for each LUSD deposited and where users can burn 1 sUSD to receive back 1 LUSD (excluding fees).

### Rationale

### Technical Specification

The LUSD token address is `0x5f98805A4E8be255a32880FDeC7F6728C6568bA0`

### Test Cases
