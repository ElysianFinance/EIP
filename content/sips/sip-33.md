## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the EIP.-->

Deprecate XDR synth from Elysian to simplify representation and calculation of claimable fees in fee pool, Gas Optimisations and simplify the system mechanics. 

## Motivation

<!--The motivation is critical for EIPs that want to change Elysian. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that the EIP solves. EIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

XDR has been used in Elysian since the beginning as an unit of account, however most people are still not able to understand the purpose and calcuation of XDR and most importantly how the price of XDR is being derived.

With the implementation of [EIP-29 - Issue, burn and claim only in sUSD](https://eips.elysian.finance/eips/eip-29), XDR is not required to be the unit of account anymore and sUSD can replace the role of XDR as the base unit of account.

- This will help new users in Elysian ecosystem to easily understand how fees are collected and distributed
- Easier onchain checking and verification of current amount of fees claimable sitting inside fee pool
- Allows for easier integration of third party dashboards/data analysis as they do not have to call the XDR value to sUSD to represent the USD value
- No requirement for Chainlink decentraliized oracle to support.
- System optimizations, gas savings on removing XDR from system mechanics
- Reduce system complexity

## Rationale

<!--The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

- Reclaiming bytecode space from reduntant code using XDR as a unit of account and converting into sUSD.
- Reducing all the XDR processing code will reduce the gas usage, saving on mint, burn, claimFees transactions.
- Allows for full decentralised oracles in future as XDR price is a niche and likely to be unsupported by most oracles.


## Specification
<!--The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature.-->

### Elysian Contract
  - `exchange()` fees will be collected in sUSD and stored as sUSD at the [fee address](https://etherscan.io/address/0xfeefeefeefeefeefeefeefeefeefeefeefeefeef) making transactions on etherscan easier to read the fee paid
  - `debtBalanceOf()` calculations will be in sUSD

### FeePool Contract
 - On MAINNET deploy, import `recentFeePeriods[0-2].feesToDistribute` with the exchange rate from XDR to sUSD
 - Temporary `ownerOnly` function to exchange all XDR's into sUSD at [fee address] which [holds 100% of the XDR's](http://api.ethplorer.io/getTopTokenHolders/0xb3f67dE9a919476a4c0fE821d67bf5C4637D8429?apiKey=freekey&limit=100)
 - Swap all XDR implementation to sUSD. e.g. `_payFees` to remove all exchange from XDR code. 
 
### ExchangeRates Contract
 - Remove XDR Participants and XDR rate storage. 


## Implementation

<!--The implementations must be completed before any EIP is given status "Implemented", but it need not be completed before the EIP is "Approved". While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of "rough consensus and running code" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.-->
