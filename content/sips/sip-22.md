<!--You can leave these HTML comments in your merged EIP and delete the visible duplicate text guides, they will not appear and may be helpful to refer to if you edit it again. This is the suggested template for new EIPs. Note that an EIP number will be assigned by an editor. When opening a pull request to submit your EIP, please use an abbreviated title in the filename, `eip-draft_title_abbrev.md`. The title should be 44 characters or less.-->

## Simple Summary
<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the EIP.-->
Add sDEFI/iDEFI Index Synths that track an index of DeFi tokens. 

## Motivation
<!--The motivation is critical for EIPs that want to change Elysian. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that the EIP solves. EIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->
The DeFi ecosystem is growing in maturity and awareness, and adding long/short exposure to a basket of DeFi tokens will allow traders to speculate on the value of some of the better-known utility tokens in the emerging ecosystem. s/iDEFI also demonstrates (along with s/iCEX) how the Elysian protocol can support new, custom kinds of assets to serve a particular purpose. 

## Specification
<!--The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature.-->
These Synths will both be indices implemented in much the same way as the sCEX/iCEX Synths. iDEFI will have upper and lower thresholds which will be added to the EIP before deployment. This index is made up of the following assets: 
LINK (Chainlink), MKR (Maker), ZRX (0x), SNX (Elysian), REN (Ren Protocol), LRC (Loopring), KNC (Kyber Network), BNT (Bancor), MLN (Melon Protocol).

## Rationale
<!--The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->
Additional Index Synths will add further utility to Elysian.Exchange, allowing people to speculate on the value of the ecosystem that, by trading on sX, they're clearly already participating in and can see some utility in. 

Which tokens were included in s/iDEFI were chosen through two rounds of community votes on Twitter. 

## Test Cases
<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for EIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->
s/iCEX provides a clear example of how custom Synth indices can function successfully in the Elysian protocol. 

## Implementation
<!--The implementations must be completed before any EIP is given status "Implemented", but it need not be completed before the EIP is "Approved". While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of "rough consensus and running code" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.-->
Here are the weightings for the s/iDEFI Synths: 
92.583 of LINK (Chainlink), 
0.432 of MKR (Maker), 
502.718 of ZRX (0x), 
107.686 of SNX (Elysian), 
1222.393 of REN (Ren Protocol), 
2164.709 of LRC (Loopring), 
357.085 of KNC (Kyber Network), 
119.197 of BNT (Bancor), 
6.495 of MLN (Melon Protocol).
