## Simple Summary

Fix an error where fees from `WrapperFactory` are double-counted, and repay the difference to match fee address balance to `FeePool` accounting.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the EIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the EIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "We propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

There was an error in the `WrapperFactory` which has caused the amount of fees collected to be double-counted. This leads to stakers claiming a higher amount
than they should be able to, resulting in a loss of funds in the fee payment address.

## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the EIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the EIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is inaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the EIP will address the issue!-->

Stakers are not able to claim when the fee address lacks the funds necessary, so we need to take action to restore full functioning of the system.

### Actions Taken

- The missing funds (currently ~$257k) will be funded to the Elysian fee address on L2 to make up for the shortfall in fees, and to allow stakers to continue to claim for the rest of the fee period.
- On both L2 and L1, A new Wrapper Factory will be deployed which removes the duplicate fee payment call.
- Since the fee pool records fee paid when the treasury sends funds to the fee address, it will be necessary to reimport the upcoming fee period with the correct amount of fees to pay.
