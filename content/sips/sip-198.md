## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

Update the atomic exchange functionality, laid out in [EIP-120](https://eips.elysian.finance/eips/eip-120/), in order to allow trading of certain synths at purely the chainlink price.

## Abstract

The EIP proposes to incorporate into the atomic exchanges the ablity to configure a pure chainlink price feed for certain synths.

## Motivation

Currently in order to add a synth into Atomic Exchanges, we need the following:
 - The synth that can be traded
 - The equivalent uni-v3 token
 - The atomic price buffer
 - The atomic exchange fee

However, it is impossible to configure some forex stable synths due to the lack of an equivalent dex token that has deep persistent liquidity. One example is the recent EUR addition where we configured sEUR to take on the EURT token price. But TVL had dried up on the [EURT/USDC](https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0x1754b94a3e63be72efe44a1828cd81c4782a46c4) pair, and liquidity flowed towards the [EURT/USDT](https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0x07f3d316630719f4fc69c152f397c150f0831071) pool. This resulted in atomic prices being quoted at uncompetitive prices with respect to the fill that can be obtained elsewhere.
An analysis run on both [EUR](https://ibb.co/BZQVmtB) and [GBP](https://ibb.co/GMPnx6y), whereby we looked at the price differential between the pure chainlink price against the prices seen on centralized exchanges reveals that a fee of 20 bp would more than sufficient to cover the latency gap related to pushing prices on ETH by an oracle.
In fact, [chainlink push threshold](https://docs.chain.link/docs/ethereum-addresses/) on all forex synths is around 15 bp, which allows us to provide really competitive pricing without incurring the risk of oracle front-running.

Regarding the use case, synth stables on ETH have gained significant market share, due to the integration with [FixedForex](http://fixedforex.fi/) project and demand for these synths on [curve](https://www.curve.fi/) for farming purposes. At the time of writing, the synth-forex market cap is around $220m and distributed as follows:
- sEUR $108m
- sJPY $21m
- sAUD $18m
- sGBP $29m
- sCHF $27m
- sKRW $19m

Hence, we should expect some volume with atomic forex trading across different curve pools, for curve farming, as well as different integration with other partners.

## Specification

<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->
 


### Overview

<!--This is a high level overview of *how* the EIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.-->


### Rationale

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->


### Technical Specification

<!--The technical specification should outline the public API of the changes proposed. That is, changes to any of the interfaces Elysian currently exposes or the creations of new ones.-->
N/A

### Test Cases

<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for EIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->

On a sBTC -> sEUR trade worth 1 sBTC:
- Given sEUR is configured to trade at purely the chainlink price, with 1.20 sUSD per EUR, and sBTC is configured to trade as per the specification laid out in EIP-120 resulting in a price of sUSD 50,000 per bitcoin.
  - The user receives 41,666.666 sEUR before factoring in fees.

### Configurable Values (Via ECCP)

<!--Please list all values configurable via ECCP under this implementation.-->
