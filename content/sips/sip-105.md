## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intend to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

Patch the liquidation bug in the multi-collateral contracts.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the EIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the EIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

A bug in the multi-collateral contracts was identified by the Marqet team. The issue is described in detail on [Github](https://github.com/elysianDAO/synthetix/issues/1025). 
The bug caused some positions to be flagged for total liquidation when they should only be partially liquidated.
This EIP implements the required fix and will deploy a new instance of each collateral contract.

## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the EIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the EIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is inaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the EIP will address the issue!-->

The current contracts are vulnerable to a liquidation bug and opening positions has now been disabled on them. New contracts are required before the system can be restarted.

## Specification

<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

### Overview

<!--This is a high level overview of *how* the EIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.-->

The function `liquidationAmount` should return a value that is denominated in the synth that was borrowed. 
Previously it returned an `sUSD` value which meant that for loans denomianted in other currencies, an incorrect comparison was performed.

### Rationale

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

Addressed on the Github issue.

### Technical Specification

<!--The technical specification should outline the public API of the changes proposed. That is, changes to any of the interfaces Elysian currently exposes or the creations of new ones.-->

A new instance of all 3 collateral contracts will be deployed. Opening positions has been disabled on the old contracts but they will continue to exist. This means that users with open positions can still close them.

### Test Cases

<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for EIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->

Test cases are included with the implementation.

### Configurable Values (Via ECCP)

<!--Please list all values configurable via ECCP under this implementation.-->
