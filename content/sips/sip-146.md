## Implementor



<!--You can leave these HTML comments in your merged EIP and delete the visible duplicate text guides, they will not appear and may be helpful to refer to if you edit it again. This is the suggested template for new EIPs. Note that an EIP number will be assigned by an editor. When opening a pull request to submit your EIP, please use an abbreviated title in the filename, `eip-draft_title_abbrev.md`. The title should be 44 characters or less.-->

## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

Allow each synth to have its own maximum supply cap, above which no more of that synth may be minted.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the EIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the EIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

The EIP will add a check on exchanges that will check to see if a given trade will mint synths such that its total supply exceeds the supply cap for that synth (as set by ECCP). If the trade will result in synths being minted above the supply cap, the trade will fail. Otherwise, the trade will proceed as usual.

## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the EIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the EIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is innaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the EIP will address the issue!-->

We have been expanding the total supply of synths and also steadily expanding our offerings of possible synths. This presents a variety of possible attacks and risk factors for the system and for SNX stakers. 

One issue of particular concern is the ability for actors to acquire large amounts of synths relative to the total market cap or trading volume of that synth. For example, it would be quite possible for someone to acquire $100m of sREN in 6 minutes, while REN the underlying is an asset with 500m fully diluted valuation and daily trading volumes on CEX of far below $100m. This presents opportunities for manipulators to attack the system by manipulating price of these less liquid synths after establishing a huge position in them.

Even without this possibility of manipulation, allowing these massive positions that are far beyond what any reasonable staker could hedge on the open market poses an unacceptable risk to stakers, who are exposed to potentially large swings in debt.

Therefore, it is desirable that each synth have a parameter, set by ECCP, that governs how much of that synth may exist at any time. This means that we can more easily regulate the change in the debt pool and, at a minimum, prevent massive positions from being acquired near instantly. While I do propose that all synths have this feature enabled, its likely that most synths can remain at a very large cap. 


## Specification

<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

TBD

### Overview

<!--This is a high level overview of *how* the EIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.-->

TBD

### Rationale

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

### Technical Specification

<!--The technical specification should outline the public API of the changes proposed. That is, changes to any of the interfaces Elysian currently exposes or the creations of new ones.-->

### Test Cases

TBD

### Configurable Values (Via ECCP)

<!--Please list all values configurable via ECCP under this implementation.-->

Each synth has its own supply cap, modifiable by ECCP. 

Broadly speaking, I recommend classifying synths into the following categories:

* Very at risk synths (sREN, s1inch, sETC, sCEX) --> target initial cap of <10m USD)
* High risk synths (sYFI, sTRX, sXTZ, sDASH, sRUNE, sXMR, sEOS, sCOMP, sCRV, sDEFI) --> target initial cap of <25m USD
* Medium risk synths (sAAVE, sDOT, sADA, sBNB, sUNI, sXRP, sLTC, sLINK) --> target initial cap of <50m
* Low risk synths (sETH, sBTC, sEQUITY, sFOREX, sCOMMODITY) --> likely no cap needed at this time

So some rough suggestions (unless otherwise mentioned, assume iSynth caps if applicable are the same as the sSynth):

* sREN / Proposed cap 5m sREN (~$2.5m at current market price)
* sRUNE / Proposed cap 2.5m sRUNE (~$25m at current market price)
* sYFI / Proposed cap 360 sYFI (~$15m at current market price)
* sAAVE / Proposed cap 100k sAAVE (~$36m at current market price)
* sDOT / Proposed cap 2m sDOT (~$42m at current market price)
* sXMR / Proposed cap 90k sXMR (~$24m at current market price)
* sDEFI / Proposed cap 2000 sDEFI (~$25m at current market price)
* sETC / Proposed cap 100k sETC (~$6m at current market price) <-- judging to this synths risk of 51% attack, very long deposit times on exchanges, and history of price feed manipulation, I suggest keeping this cap lower.
* sADA / Proposed cap 32m sADA (~$50m at current market price)
* sEOS / Proposed cap 5m sEOS (~$25m at current market price)
* sBNB / Proposed cap 150k sBNB (~$50m at current market price)
* sCRV / Proposed cap 10m sCRV (~$22m at current market price)
* sTRX / Proposed cap 200m sTRX (~$14m at current market price)
* sUNI / Proposed cap 20m sUNI (~$50m at current market price)
* sCOMP / Proposed cap 50k sCOMP (~$18m at current market price)
* sCEX / Proposed cap 1000 sCEX (~$6m at current market price)
* sLTC / Proposed cap 300k sLTC (~$50m at current market price)
* s1INCH / Proposed cap 2m s1inch (~$6m at current market price)
* sXTZ / Proposed cap 5m sXTZ (~$17m at current market price)
* sDASH / Proposed cap 100k sDASH (~$17m at current market price)
* sXRP / Proposed cap 60m sXRP (~$52m at current market price)
* sLINK / Proposed cap 4m sLINK (~$96m at current market price) <-- sLINK already has substantial market interest of over 2.2m sLINK, and it also has a significantly more responsive oracle than the other altcoins. Therefore a somewhat higher initial cap is justified.
