## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

This EIP proposes to deprecate inverse synths in favour of the shorting mechanism introduced in [EIP 103](https://eips.elysian.finance/eips/eip-103). Once this EIP is implemented and iSynths are removed from the protocol a planned upgrade of Multi-collateral shorts will allow for more assets to be added to the shorting mechanism.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the EIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the EIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

This EIP will remove inverse synths from the protocol by pausing exchanging into all inverse Synths then deprecating them for future redemption via the `SynthRedeemer` contract introduced in [EIP-174](./eip-174.md).

## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the EIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the EIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is innaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the EIP will address the issue!-->

With the introduction of shorting in Multi-collateral loans [EIP-103](./eip-103.md) the ability to open natural shorts on ETH and BTC was introduced without using iETH or iBTC.

The ongoing management of iSynths requires manual intervention by the pDAO to purge all holders and reset them each time they freeze. The design of the inverse synths pricing also introduced leverage as they reached their upper / lower limits, which required exchange fees to be increased to deal with frontrunning.

Upgrades to the multi-collateral loan and shorts contracts on L1 will enable shorting on a wider range of assets, starting with the top ten traded Synths by volume.

## Specification

<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

### Overview

### Technical Specification

1. Pause exchanges on all iSynths.
2. Remove iSynths from the Elysian (deprecating them), remove aggregators from exchangeRates contract, resume any synths that are suspended (allowing them to be transferable again)

### Test Cases

### Configurable Values

N/A
